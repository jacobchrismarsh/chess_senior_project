# Senior Project
## Gaston Aganza and Jacob Marshall
### Advised by Philip Nico 

# Run front-end
## With Yarn installed 

- `cd /chess/frontend/gui`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

# Run back-end

In a separate window, but still in the project's root directory:

-  `pip3 install -r requirements`
- `cd chess/backend/src/`
- `python3 manage.py migrate` (You only need to do this on the first run)
- `python3 manage.py runserver`
